Hi, I'm Jonathan Cardenas - I've been working in the software engineering space for about 10 years now, juggling quite a number of hats. I've done both front-end and back-end engineering work, and more recently I've spent the past 3 or so years working with cloud infrastructure and DevOps work. 

Regarding my education, I own a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science with Specialization in Software Technology from [De La Salle University](https://www.dlsu.edu.ph/) and was a part of its Game Development Laboratory from 2012 to 2014, the year I graduated.

On the side, I do lots of reading and am very interested in the gaming industry. Games are what fuelled my passion for languages, as I started learning Japanese from a very young age in order to be able to understand Japanese games. On occasion I have helped my peers to translate text either from Japanese to English or Chinese to English.
