In this page you can download or view projects I have worked on in the past for your viewing or perusal.

## EOSIO Developer's Portal

[Visit the developer portal](https://developers.eos.io/)

I was the lead developer on the EOSIO Developer's Portal, a comprehensive website powered by [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.com) for prospective EOSIO developers to get started and to easily have a reference on how to create smart contracts powered by the `eos.io` protocol. The documentation pages are statically generated based on a proprietary Python tool I developed that ingests a mixture of C++ code and Markdown code to generate the pages. 

## `eosio-explorer`

GitHub repository: [Here](https://github.com/EOSIO/eosio-explorer)

A web application that can be run locally that assists `eosio` developers in creating dApps and other related applications on the `EOS.IO` blockchain. The tool can connect to blockchain nodes of developers allowing teams to test and verify their work. It is primarily used for smart contract development.

## OneOne (formerly known as Huboo)

Google Play Store Link: [Here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=huboo.android)

Developed from 2016 to 2018, OneOne formerly known as Huboo was a hybrid mobile and website application that targeted the gamer demographic and was advertised as "Tinder for Gamers." Users would be allowed to reserve gameplay sessions with prospective influencers and other public figures in the space by spending in-app currency that could be bought with real money. It was first launched back in 2017 coinciding with that year's Taiwan Game Show. 

I served as the primary and sole back-end engineer for the application and also did support for both application issues and for customers.
